# 2048game-docker-Elastic Beanstalk
First Method: Creating the 2048 Game Application using Docker

Begin by creating a directory named "2048-game" where you'll set up your Dockerized 2048 game.

Inside the "2048-game" directory, create a Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will contain instructions for building the Docker image for your game application.

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile by running the following command in your terminal:

         $docker build . -t 2048-game
This command tells Docker to build an image named "2048-game" from the Dockerfile in the current directory.

Once the image is built, you can create a container from it using the following command:

     $docker run -d -p 80:80 2048-game:latest
 
You can now access your 2048 game application in your web browser by entering the IP address of your host machine and port 80.


Second Method: Creating the 2048 Game Application using Elastic Beanstalk

Navigate to the Elastic Beanstalk service in your AWS account.

Create a new application by specifying a name, for example, "2048-game." Choose "Docker" as the platform for your application.

Select the appropriate platform branch, which in this case would be "Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2."

When prompted to upload your code, choose the "Local file" option, and then upload your Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will define how your 2048 game application should be run within the Docker container.

Elastic Beanstalk will automatically take care of provisioning all the necessary infrastructure for your application. You won't need to worry about capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, or patch updates. Elastic Beanstalk manages it all for you.

 After the environment is created, you will receive a CNAME (Canonical Name) for your application. This CNAME is an indicator that your 2048 game app is running successfully. You can use this CNAME to access your game in a web browser.

Both methods provide a way to deploy the 2048 game application, with Docker allowing you to set it up locally and Elastic Beanstalk simplifying the deployment process by managing infrastructure on AWS.
